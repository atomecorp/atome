Cross platform ecosystem
-

- atome is a cross platform development framework, aim to build mobile or desktop applications, web site, games, presentations, and lots more...

- atome's applications can be deploy as a simple application, a client, a server or both, as well as be booted at startup (Operating System. mode)

- all apis work identically, to ensure you'll have the exact same rendering whatever the host platform (Android, Freebsd, linux, MacOs, Web, Windows).

- atome and all the included libraries are entirely open source with a very permissive MIT licence. it means you can do what you want want with it!

- the framework is totally hybrid, it can be executed as a full blown native application, a native application with a web view, in a web browser or a web view

- Atome can be used in stand alone (offline mode), in cloud mode or both and sync data when required

- it's also possible to publish websites on a static server (without server side language) while using a database and sync data between users

- Anything in atome can be scripted, even on the fly at runtime!
