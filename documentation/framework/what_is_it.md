**what is (an) atome?**
-

The concept
-

atome object is the uniq object that can hold any type of data!

Think pdf but collaborative, truly multimedia and editable!
-

An atome can be anything from a single property to a full blown document.

Per example an atome can hold a simple property such as a color, or an image,a text, an effect, a video, a script, a group of objects or a complex document mixing many types, even tools that create and modify atomes are atomes!

Say goodbye to apps : any atome can be modified by any tools created for them.
-

The idea behind atome is to have a uniq file type, so any tool applied on a given atome will lead to an action whatever the atome type is.
The benefits are:

- Simplify the automation of batch process, as objects always have a similar architecture whatever it's type (from a simple box thru a video montage to a complex page description) it's always an atome)
- Simplify the development and tests of new tools. Ruby language allow you to script anything on the fly
- Reduce development time due to Ruby language simplicity and the similar structure of atomes and APIs
- Easy debug due to high level of readability of ruby
- Reduce the number of tools needed for an application. (you dont ever have to wrote a specific tool for a specific medias anymore, as the same tool can be applied onto any atome).
- and many many other advantages inherent to the atome architecture ...


Say goodbye to file format: here any tools can alter any data.
-

- No filetype but instead a unique objet call  "atome" 
- Any atome can then be modified by any available api or tool.
- Only one type means no more file format, this is the guaranty that documents can always be open, shared and edited.

Guideline and philosophy
-

to keep this concept working we must follow the following rules during atome development :

- All Apis must run of all targeted platform (their should be no difference from one platform to another.)
- Any property or new api must always work on any type of atome, to keep the consistency of the "atome uniq object"
