- monstruous bug when inserting an object into an other, the child lose it's position, the offset is also fucked, the bug is worse when deleting and enliven an atome!!!
- monstruous bug 2 when enliven atome child often it's drag ability and sometimes disapear
- render and enliven loose centering
- make enliven works when object has child or parent ex :  b = box({id: :toto})
                                                           b.color(:red)
                                                           t=b.text({content: :kooly, id: :titi, color: :white, y: 150})
                                                           t.y(150)
                                                           b.touch do
                                                            b.delete(true)
                                                           end
                                                           r=text({content: :reanimator,color: :orange, y: 20})
                                                           r.touch do
                                                            get(:titi).enliven(true)
                                                           end
- prevent object from beeing insert many times in the same parent
- allow this syntax a.x=b.x-c.x( not possible because of content) maybe complex property should have two kind of return a simple and a full. ex a.x => 20 a_.x_full => {content: 20 , dynamic: true}
- add and atome array and atome hash that inherit ruby array and hash to allow easy batch of atomes
- add creation of atome's array to allow batch treatment
- solve render bug (see render example)
- utilities in Neutron needs to a bit of integration to work with example
- centering is not removed when settings x or y value
- stack and allow to remove and pause  all events and specifics
- using .property method destroy event such as 'touch'
- proper delete
- proper object creation
- clean and astandardize all properties
- caret handling
